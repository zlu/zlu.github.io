My name is Zhao Lü.  Zhao is pronounced as ciao with a j and it means to encourage oneself in Chinese.  I was born in Beijing, China.  I've lived in Arizona, California, London, and New York.  I'm permanently based in San Francisco and I travel quite a bit.

I'm a programmer who enjoys practicing yoga.  

I've worked in technology for a while and have dipped my foot in storage, insurance, telecommunication, and social media marketing industries.  As a developer, I am interested in different programming languages (Ruby, Java, Erlang, C)and paradigms.  I like to tinker with hardware such as Arduino and Beagleboard as well.  In 2012, I attended [Deborah Burkman](https://www.foryogi.com/teachers/503)'s yoga retreat in Koh Samui, Thailand.  I had already quit my job prior to that as I'd like to start something of my own.  It took me 4 months after the yoga retreat to figure out what I wanted to do.  In December of 2012, I started [ForYogi](https://foryogi.com).  It's a perfect blend of my two passions, writing code for yoga.

I now spend time between ForYogi, consulting, and advising start-ups.  

In my spare time, I like to [read][goodreads], taking [photos][flickr], and doing outdoor activities such as biking and hiking.  I used to spend a lot of time running (road and trail) until knee injuries stopped me.  I spent a good amount of times playing indoor and sand volleyball as well as basketball.  I used to surf in Santa Cruz and Hawaii.
