My last blog entry was in 2016, sometime after I left my beloved Brazil and colleagues from EasyTaxi.  Over the past nine years, I've spent most of my time in Europe, primarily in Switzerland and Germany, which are both wonderful countries.  Now I'm enjoying more time in Beijing, my birth place.

The urge to blog has returned along with the move.  Over the years, Beijing's population has grown from 18 Million to 23 Million, with neighboring cities and townships being annexed along the way.  Today, Beijing is roughtly 20 times the size of Berlin.  Interestingly, despite its larger population, it doesn't feel as crowded any more - perhaps due to its spread-out nature. 

For example, lives at the edge of the third ring, which was considered outside the city in the 1980s.  Now it is bustling with commercial activity, just like the classic city center.

I need a momoent to compliment [WayBackMachine](https://web.archive.org/web/20190301000000*/https://zlu.me).  There are things even git can't save-due to human error.  But Wayback Machine does it all without any notice.  I've recovered a few blogged entries from here.
