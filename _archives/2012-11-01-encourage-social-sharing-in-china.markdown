I recently spent a month in China, where access to Facebook, Twitter, and GooglePlus are blocked.  I've always known
about the Great Firewall, but I never really thought about how it can affect content-sharing that I have grown used to over
the past years.

I have been using @octopress for blogging.  Octopress has built-in sharing function for Twitter, Facebook, and GooglePlus.
But none of it works in China.  To encourage social sharing, I add basic support for [Sina Weibo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo).

* Weibo share button, on the bottom of the blog entry, allows users to easily share the url.  It also displays how many
times the entry has been shared.
* A follow button (and follower count) on the side bar for Weibo.

Here is the source code: [Octopress Sina Weibo](https://github.com/zlu/octopress-sinaweibo)

I hope more people will implement social-sharing for Chinese audience.

Here is the [developer platform for Sina Weibo](http://open.weibo.com), only in Chinese.
