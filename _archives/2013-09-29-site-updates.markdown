####[Spotify Play List](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-play-button/)

I added my yoga playlist on [Spotify](http://www.spotify) on the sidebar, below recent posts.
I changed default theme to white and used minimum width 250 for the widget.
Here is the [first commit](https://github.com/zlu/octopress/commit/6b8ff500d01109b390ec1e1f79502d1fc4a1adbe).

See [documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-play-button/documentation/) for more customization options.

####Change Log
Based on this [gist](https://gist.github.com/alx/730347), I added a change log (a Jekyll plugin) for this blog, just for fun.  The change log is on the side bar under tweets.  It displays the last 10 commits.

Here is a relevant [commit](https://github.com/zlu/octopress/commit/2dc9ad5cade9cea359a3d8bd39752c90fb000f91).
