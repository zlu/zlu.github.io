An embedding is a learned representation of data in a lower-dimensional space. It transforms high-dimensional, discrete, or symbolic data (like words, users, or items) into dense, continuous vectors that preserve semantic or structural relationships.

Why use embeddings?
- Reduce dimensionality
- Enable similarity comparison
- Improve learning by preserving structure
