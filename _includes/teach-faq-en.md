**How does online computer science tutoring work?**

My lessons are conducted via ClassIn, Tencent Meeting, Zoom, Google Hangouts, or WeChat video. You can send me your
code, assignments, or questions in advance, and I’ll tailor the lesson content for you, such as debugging Python
programs or explaining AI algorithms.

**Are AI and data science courses suitable for beginners?**

Absolutely! I adjust the content based on your level. For beginners, I start with Python basics and gradually introduce
data science tools (e.g., Pandas, scikit-learn) or AI concepts (e.g., machine learning models). Experienced students can
dive into advanced topics like deep learning or big data analysis.

**How much does each tutoring session cost?**

Fees vary based on the type of course and frequency. Please contact me for a detailed quote!

**My English isn’t great—will that affect my computer science learning?**

No worries! I can teach in both Chinese and English, explaining complex AI terms or data science concepts clearly to
ensure you understand. Programming code will also be explained with examples, making it easy to follow.
