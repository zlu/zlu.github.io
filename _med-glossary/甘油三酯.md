Triglycerides are a type of fat (lipid) found in the blood. They are the most common form of fat in the body and serve as a primary source of energy.  

- **Formation**: Triglycerides are produced when the body converts excess calories (from foods like carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) that are not immediately used for energy. They are stored in fat cells and released into the bloodstream when energy is needed.  
- **Role**: They provide energy to cells throughout the body, especially during periods of fasting or physical activity.  
- **Health impact**: While essential for normal bodily functions, *high levels of triglycerides* (hypertriglyceridemia) in the blood can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and pancreatitis. High levels are often linked to poor diet (high in sugar and refined carbs), obesity, lack of exercise, excessive alcohol intake, or certain medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypothyroidism).  

Normal triglyceride levels typically range from 0 to 150 mg/dL (0 to 1.7 mmol/L), though ranges may vary slightly by lab.
