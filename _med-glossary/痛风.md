Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to sudden and severe pain, redness, and swelling—most commonly in the big toe, but it can affect other joints as well. It is often related to high levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia), which may result from diet, genetics, or certain medical conditions.
