My name is Zhao Lü (吕钊). Zhao is pronounced as 'ciao' with a 'j' and it means to encourage oneself in Chinese. I was born in Beijing, China. I have lived in USA, UK, Brazil, Switzerland, France, and Germany. I travel quite a bit, 60 countries and counting.

I'm a programmer who enjoys practicing yoga.  

I've worked in technology for a while and have dipped my foot in storage, insurance, telecommunication, and social media marketing industries.  As a developer, I am interested in different programming languages (Python, Ruby, Java, Erlang, C) and paradigms.  In the recently years I've started paying more attention to machine learning and algorithms.  I like to tinker with hardware such as Arduino and Beagleboard as well.  In 2012, I attended Deborah Burkman's yoga retreat in Koh Samui, Thailand.  I had already quit my job prior to that as I'd like to start something of my own.  It took me 4 months after the yoga retreat to figure out what I wanted to do.  In December of 2012, I started ForYogi, a market place for yogis.  It's a perfect blend of my two passions, writing code for yoga.  

In my spare time, I like to read, take photos with my rangefinder camera, biking and hiking. I used to spend a lot of time running (road and trail) until knee injuries stopped me. I spent a good amount of time playing indoor and sand volleyball as well as basketball. I used to surf in Santa Cruz and Hawaii.
